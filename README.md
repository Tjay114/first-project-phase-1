# first-project-phase-1
My firstÂ Website.
Through my first month of coding that is in CSS, JavaScript and HTML and learning the basics of programming it has been very inspiring which has made me to decide on putting what I have learned over the month to test and decided to do a sample website project of which I decided on incorporating all the three programming languages by which I used them in-tandem so as to archive the website objectives of passing information.
The project that I decided on working on was  keeping track of the trends of daily Corona(COVID-19) cases on a global wide perspective and the trends of the confirmed cases, to the recovered cases as well as the total deaths over the global perspective.
With the help of some research as well as some help from my colleagues I was able to archive the major objective work of all three languages of programming I was able to not only design this website but I was also able to incorporate the different CSS styles so as to give the website the different styles, different JavaScript functions as well as event listeners I was able to get the different website parts to archive the objective of allowing us to add more interactive functionality to HTML elements by "listening" to different events that takes place on the page. Moreover, I used the HTML file so as to tell the website browser how to display text,images as well as other forms multimedia on my web page.
